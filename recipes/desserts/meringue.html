        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>4 Large Egg Whites</li>
            <li>115g Caster Sugar</li>
            <li>115g Icing Sugar</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Method</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Heat the oven to 110Â°C.</li>
            <br>
            <li>Line 2 baking sheets with non-stick liner.</li>
            <br>
            <li>Tip 4 large egg whites into a large clean mixing bowl. Beat them on medium speed with an electric hand whisk until the mixture resembles a fluffy cloud and stands up in stiff peaks when the blades are lifted.</li>
            <br>
            <li>Turn the speed up and add the caster sugar, a dessertspoonful at a time. Continue beating for 3-4 seconds between each addition. It's important to add the sugar slowly at this stage as it helps prevent the meringue from weeping later. The mixture should be thick and glossy.</li>
            <br>
            <li>Sift one third of the 115g icing sugar over the mixture, then gently fold it in with a big metal spoon or rubber spatula. Continue to sift and fold in the remaining icing sugar a third at a time. The mixture should not look smooth and billowy.</li>
            <br>
            <li>Scoop up a heaped dessertspoonful of the mixture. Ease it on to the baking sheet to make and oval shape.</li>
            <br>
            <li>Bake for 1.5-1.75 hours until the meringues are a pale coffee colour.</li>
            <br>
            <li>Leave to cool on the trays or a cooling rack.</li>
        </ol>
